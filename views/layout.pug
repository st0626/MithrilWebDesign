                h2 About Me
                p I'm a father first and foremost. I have 2 beautiful children that encouraged me to do web design. I love what I do, and I can't wait to talk to you about your website needs. I am an avid learner and love to learn new technologies to build websites. I'm constantly on the prowl for the next best thing.

                h2 My process
                p When I'm building your website, I'm constantly in communication with you and your needs. This is key to good design in my opinion. Everything I do is communicated through wireframes and voice/texting. I am constantly looking to improve on designs and love feedback. I will never tell you that your idea is stupid. It's important to me that you are happy with your design.
